            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>a small business making homemade bread and pastries. I learned to bake in the way that I watched YouTube tutorials and procedures on how to properly make the pastries I'm making now I tried to bake even simple bread and the time came when I tried to sell it

              I also began to market my business through social media, posting pictures of my delicious creations and offering special deals for first-time customers.. I was amazed at how delicious the bread tasted and how much cheaper it was to make it at home than to buy it from the store. I started experimenting with different types of bread and pastries and soon became quite good at it.then  I try selling my bread and pastries to our neighbors. At first, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give it a try. I baked a few loaves of bread and some chocolate croissant
                As my business grew, I started to think about how I could expand. I decided to start taking orders in advance so that I could plan out my baking schedule and avoid wasting any ingredients
